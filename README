WebDAVUI - Sharing, browsing and deleting files
=================================================

This extension can be built with the LibreOffice SDK.

1. On Ubuntu, install libreoffice-dev.
2. Setup the SDK: /usr/lib/libreoffice/basis3.3/sdk/setsdkenv_unix
3. ./waf configure
4. ./waf build

You can either install system-wide

5. sudo ./waf install

Or create a webdavui.oxt package:

5. ./waf oxt

Tip: Specify --debug in step 3 to enable verbose console output.

Due to caching of extensions, it can happen that LibreOffice doesn't fully pick
up changes if you install a new version. There's a command to clear the caches:

6. sudo -E ./waf clear_caches

*** Build on Windows ***

Install LibreOffice and SDK to a location WITHOUT spaces, such as C:\Apps\LibreOffice3.4

To build on Windows, setup Cygwin like this*:

setup.exe -P autoconf,automake,bison,cabextract,flex,gcc-g++,git,gnupg,gperf,libxm2-devel,libpng12-devel,make,mintty,openssh,openssl,patch,perl,pkg-config,readline,rsync,unzip,vim,wget,zip¹

Also install Visual C++ 2008 Express.

Copy /usr/include/libreoffice/sal/typesizes.h to C:\Apps\LibreOffice3.4\Basis\sdk\include .

** Continue in a native command prompt **

Install Python 2.7.

Run this every time you start working:

C:\Apps\LibreOffice3.4\Basis\sdk\setsdkenv_windows.bat

C:\Python27\python waf configure
C:\Python27\python waf build
C:\Python27\python waf oxt

Debugging:

Pass --debug to 'configure' to enable verbose console output.
Open another command prompt.
Run LibreOffice like so: C:\Apps\LibreOffice3.4\program\soffice.exe > debug.txt
After closing LibreOffice or after a crash, you can see the output in the
file debug.txt in the current folder.

Warning: Don't use Samba and don't use virtual drive letters!

Due to caching of extensions, it can happen that LibreOffice doesn't fully pick
up changes if you install a new version. There's a command to clear the caches:

C:\Python27\python waf clear_caches
